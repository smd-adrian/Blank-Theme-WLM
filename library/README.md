# HTML template with Laravel Mix

Custom structure to manage your assets (js, css, images and sources). This template uses Laravel Mix to manage all the essential tasks to build on the web. It contains some essential libraries to start the FrontEnd development, these libraries and the dependencies are handled through Node.js.
